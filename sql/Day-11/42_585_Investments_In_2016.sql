-- Question 42 : 585. Investments in 2016
-- https://leetcode.com/problems/investments-in-2016/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-sql-50
-- Write a solution to report the sum of all total investment values in 2016 tiv_2016, for all policyholders who: have the same tiv_2015 value as one or more other policyholders, and
-- are not located in the same city as any other policyholder (i.e., the (lat, lon) attribute pairs must be unique). Round tiv_2016 to two decimal places.
-- Key Point : Duplicate 2015 value + Unique location → Sum 2016.
SELECT 
    ROUND(SUM(tiv_2016), 2) AS tiv_2016
FROM
    Insurance
WHERE
    tiv_2015 IN (SELECT 
            tiv_2015
        FROM
            Insurance
        GROUP BY tiv_2015
        HAVING COUNT(*) > 1)
        AND (lat , lon) IN (SELECT 
            lat, lon
        FROM
            Insurance
        GROUP BY lat , lon
        HAVING COUNT(*) = 1);
